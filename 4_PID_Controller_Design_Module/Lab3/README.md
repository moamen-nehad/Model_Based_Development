#Summary

This lab investigated the behavior of open-loop and closed-loop systems without the use of controllers, modeled and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The open-loop system operated solely on the input signal, lacking any feedback or error correction, which made it unable to adapt to disturbances or input changes. In contrast, the closed-loop configuration introduced a feedback path, allowing the system to automatically adjust its response based on output conditions. While no explicit controller was added, the feedback inherently improved stability, reduced steady-state errors, and enhanced the systemâ€™s robustness to changes. An important observation was that the introduction of feedback decreased the overall system gain, resulting in a lower output amplitude compared to the open-loop case. This experiment highlighted the fundamental role of feedback in control systems, even in the absence of active control elements.
