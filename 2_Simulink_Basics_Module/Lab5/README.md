In this project, I designed and simulated a temperature control system using MATLAB and Simulink. I modeled the system using a first-order differential equation and implemented it in Simulink with adjustable parameters for system gain and time constant. I analyzed the system response to a step input setpoint and tuned the parameters to improve performance. Finally, I explored embedded code generation using MATLAB Embedded Coder and the Quick Start tool, demonstrating how control models can be deployed to embedded systems.
