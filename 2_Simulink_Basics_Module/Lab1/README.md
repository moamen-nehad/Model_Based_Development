In this lab, I learned how to use basic Simulink blocks. I used the Product block to multiply two numbers, the Gain block to scale a number, and the Sum block to add numbers. I also used the Constant block to give fixed values and the Display block to see the results. Everything was easy to connect, and the simulation ran without problems. This helped me understand how each block works and how to make a simple model in Simulink.
