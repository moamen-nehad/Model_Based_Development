In this lab, I designed and simulated an automated irrigation control system using Simulink. The system used soil moisture as an input and controlled a pump based on two thresholds to maintain moisture within a desired range. When moisture dropped below the lower threshold, the pump turned ON, and when it exceeded the upper threshold, the pump turned OFF. Soil moisture dynamics were modeled to show natural drying and irrigation effects. The simulation produced a repeating sawtooth pattern of moisture levels, which matches the expected behavior of an ON/OFF hysteresis-based control system. This lab demonstrated threshold-based control logic and basic modeling of actuator and environmental dynamics.
